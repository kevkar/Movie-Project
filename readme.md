#Readme for Movie Project

Movie Time 

This Java program arranges movies by their length to make it easier to figure out what to watch on any given night.

There are six possible buttons on the GUI.

1. Add a movie with it's length
2. Remove a movie
3. Clear the database
4. Open the corresponding movie search on letterboxd.com
5. Display a random movie
6. List all movies in the database

In the future, the program will be hooked up to a database for storage. 

All tests complete and the program runs fine on any desktop. Just clone the depository and fire it up on any Java IDE.

For a picture of the UI, see MovieProgramGUI.jpg.
