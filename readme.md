This is the much inferior version I did before I learned anything about programming really. Go to movie project 2 for something better!


Movie Time 

This Java program arranges movies by their length to make it easier to figure out what to watch on any given night.
Users enter a movie with its length which is entered into an auto-sorted database.

There are six possible buttons on the GUI.

1. Add a movie with it's length
2. Remove a movie
3. Remove all movies
4. Open a search for the movie on letterboxd.com
5. Display a random movie
6. Display all movies entered

The program writes movies to a text file that you can edit and will make changes to the database.

All tests complete and the program runs fine on any desktop. Just clone the depository and fire it up on any Java IDE.
